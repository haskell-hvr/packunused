description:
  This simple CLI tool allows to find out which of the packages listed as
  @build-depends@ in a Cabal package description file are redundant.
  .
  @packunused@ works by taking advantage of GHC's
  @-ddump-minimal-imports@ feature which creates @.import@ files for
  each compiled module containing a /minimal/ set of explicit import
  declarations. These @.import@ files together with Cabal's generated
  package configuration meta-data is analyzed by @packunused@ to
  detect potentially redundant package dependencies.
  .
  In order to use @packunused@ you have to configure the package as
  usual. See the example session below:
  .
  > cabal clean
  > rm *.imports
  > cabal configure -O0 --disable-library-profiling
  > cabal build --ghc-option=-ddump-minimal-imports
  > packunused
  .
  The @-O0 --disable-library-profiling@ options are just to speed up
  compilation. In some cases you might want to pass additional options
  to the @configure@ step, such as @--enable-benchmark@ or
  @--enable-tests@.
  .
  When run, @packunused@ prints a report to standard output listing
  its findings for each component built. The following is an example
  for the @packunused@ package itself, with a redundant dependency
  added for demonstration on purpose:
  .
